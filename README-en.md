## ‚úèÔ∏è Introduction

API repository for Softplan related to the Front-end Developer PL position. I created an API to simulate the back-end of the [main repository](https://github.com/nardini-22/teste-softplan) using Node, json-server, and json-server-auth, which includes CRUD of users. The API also features an authorization flow via JWT and guarded routes.

## üåê Demo

https://teste-softplan-api.vercel.app/

## üöß Routes
  - Login
    - POST /login - Logs into the application and returns a JWT to the user, which is required for guarded routes.
  - Users (Guarded route)
    - POST /users - Create a new user
    - GET /users - Return all the users
    - GET /users/:id - Return all data from a user
    - PATCH /users/:id - Edit user data
    - DELETE /users/:id - Delete user
